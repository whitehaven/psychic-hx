	I can't think of how to encapsulate where I am today. Let me step through my life and see what I find.
	Some psychotherapists regard the age of 12 as special. Perhaps because it is the dawn of introspection - the first time we consider the operation of our own minds, rather than only to be that operation. 
	I remember symbols of duty appealed to me more than any notions of godly love. I learned the religion and talked the talk, like you do in any group. It was like a fictional universe, a Star Wars or Lord of the Rings. There are alternative rules and people whose veracity is unimportant. It's a fun story. It could have modernish morals, or fly against them. 
	The Mormon universe has rules and people, but it is also a entity with real positions, real accolades, and real power. Its acceptance of the individual comes from conformity. I know that's not a new insight, but this is an odd type. Doing the practices, following the commands, these are absolute requirements. Are you required to act, dress, groom, speak, and worship like your counterparts? Not exactly. But for all the rhetoric that we can think differently, I dare you to mention once that you dislike the temple service, or that the garment is too long for no reason and you think you should be able to modify your own underwear. Feel the oxygen freeze and fall like soft, blue snow. You're walking on the dark side.
